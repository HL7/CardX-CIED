The definition for the element 'Observation.category' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-category|5.0.0' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental
The definition for the element 'Observation.referenceRange.type' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/referencerange-meaning|5.0.0' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental

# 02 Supressing warnings related to CardX-CIED specific terminology.
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
