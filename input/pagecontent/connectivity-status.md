### Introduction
Remote monitoring patients with Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs) was first introduced in the early 2000s and has grown to become the standard of care for managing patients. 

Patient connectivity to remote monitoring is critical for the success of an RM program and most importantly for the patient to realize the known benefits of RM (see Section 2.2). Rapid management of disconnected patients is imperative. This responsibility falls on the patient and the device clinic. It is important that every reasonable effort be made by the clinic to reach the disconnected patient. Manufacturers as collaborative partners can assist by providing a notification directly to the patient about a disconnection and can provide technical support if needed. This time-intensive process that includes contacting the patient and troubleshooting the issue(s) can be accomplished by adequately trained nonclinical or clinical staff with adequate time budgeted for this important task.
