Title: "ISO/IEEE-11073-10103"
* #753665 "Pacemaker"
    "A battery powered implantable device that uses low voltage pulses to stimulate the heart when it is beating too slow."
* #753666 "Defibrillator"
    "A battery powered implantable device that uses high voltage energy to shock the heart when it is beating too fast and mostly includes pacemaker functionality."
* #753667 "Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy - Defibrillator"
    "A battery powered implantable device that uses low voltage pulses to stimulate the ventricles of the heart in multiple locations to increase blood pumping efficiency and also includes pacemaker and defibrillator functionality."
* #753668 "Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy - Pacemaker"
    "A battery powered implantable device that uses low voltage pulses to stimulate the ventricles of the heart in multiple locations to increase blood pumping efficiency and also includes pacemaker functionality."
* #753669 "Implantable Diagnostic Monitor"
    "A battery powered implantable device that monitors and records cardiac activity and does not deliver any therapy."
