They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The Formal Profile Definition below provides the formal summary, definitions, and terminology requirements.\n\nMDC_IDC_DEV contains the following data elements:\nMDC_IDC_DEV_TYPE\nMDC_IDC_DEV_MODEL\nMDC_IDC_DEV_SERIAL\nMDC_IDC_DEV_MFG\n\nOpen Items:\nMDC_IDC_DEV_TYPE - if using type, can include MDC_IDC enums in a valueset. Do we want to also allow SNOMED?\n\n**Each Device must have:**\n- a patient\n- a manufacturer\n- a UDI or device serial number\n",
